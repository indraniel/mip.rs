# Markdown in Preview - Rust edition

After a first attempt of developing [MiP in
Crystal](https://github.com/mipmip/mip.cr), Rust seems a better choice.  Rust
should support parallism better so it is able ro run webview next to a
webserver.

## Todo ugly version

- [x] webserver
- [x] free port finder
- [x] markdown stuff
- [x] inotify
- [ ] templating

## Todo polished version

- [ ] command line options
- [ ] error handling
- [ ] use reload and not javascript reload
- [ ] refactor
