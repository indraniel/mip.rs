# Markdown in Preview - Rust edition

After a first attempt of developing [MiP in
Crystal](https://github.com/mipmip/mip.cr), Rust seems a better choice.  Rust
should support parallism better so it is able ro run webview next to a
webserver.

# TODO

- [ ] implement markdown stuff
- [ ] implement webserver
- [ ] free port finder
- [ ] implement command line options
- [ ]  templating
