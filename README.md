# Markdown in Preview - Rust edition

![](markdown.png)

After a first attempt of developing [MiP in
Crystal](https://github.com/mipmip/mip.cr), Rust seems a better choice.  Rust
should support parallism better so it is able ro run webview next to a
webserver.

## Todo ugly version

- [x] webserver
- [x] free port finder
- [x] markdown stuff
- [x] inotify
- [x] templating
- [x] remove frontmatter
- [x] images

## later

- [ ] command line options
- [ ] improve error handling
- [ ] use webview reload and not javascript reload
- [ ] refactor
- [ ] testing
- [ ] git workflow
- [ ] export pdf
- [ ] export html
- [ ] add readme: contrib
- [ ] add readme: dev
- [ ] add releases
