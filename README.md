# Markdown in Preview - Rust edition

After a first attempt of developing [MiP in
Crystal](https://github.com/mipmip/mip.cr), Rust seems a better choice.  Rust
should support parallism better so it is able ro run webview next to a
webserver.

# TODO

- [ ] markdown stuff
- [ ] webserver
- [ ] free port finder
- [ ] command line options
- [ ] templating
- [ ] inotify
